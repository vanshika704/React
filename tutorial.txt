Creating and nesting components
 A component is a piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic and appearance.

 function MyButton() {
  return (
    <button>I'm a button</button>
  );
}


nesting it:
export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my app</h1>
      <MyButton />
    </div>
  );
}
