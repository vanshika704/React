Creating and nesting components
 A component is a piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic and appearance.

 function MyButton() {
  return (
    <button>I'm a button</button>
  );
}


nesting it:
export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my app</h1>
      <MyButton />
    </div>
  );
}

React component names must always start with a capital letter, while HTML tags must be lowercase.for example notice that <MyButton /> first alphabet is capital,

Writing markup with JSX 
JSX is stricter than HTML. You have to close tags like <br />. Your component also canâ€™t return multiple JSX tags. You have to wrap them into a shared parent, like a <div>...</div> or an empty <>...</> wrapper
